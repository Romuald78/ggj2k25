===================================================
ELEMENTAL ALTAR : Bubble Edition
V1.0.0
===================================================

This game has been created during the Global Game Jam 2025 between Friday, the 24th and Sunday the 26th of January.

The Global Game Jam gographical site was :
    ESIEE-IT Engineer School
    Pontoise - West suburb of Paris
    FRANCE

This game is only playable with USB Gamepads.
It has been tested with XBOX-360 and XBOX-One controllers, and even with Gamecube controllers via a Mayflash Adapter.
This means, the button mapping seems to be correct at least with these brands of gamepads.

The game is playable between 2 and 4 players localy, on the same computer.
When you are in the splash screen, juste press any button to enter in the player select screen.
Then you have to press the 'A' button once to register : a bubble appears and you can move it with your left stick.
As you move the bubble over a character, this last one starts to be lighter and you can press 'A' to select it.
When done it is not possible to move anymore. But you still can press 'B' to unselect the character.
If you don't have any character selected you can press 'B' once again to unregister, and if you are the only one registered player, you return to the splash screen

If at least two players are registered, when any of them press 'A' the game starts.

===================================================
GAME RULES/MECHANICS
===================================================

When the game starts, the registered characters are randomized around the square game area.
Each character can move along one edge of the area (either up/down for players on the left and right edges, or left/right for the characters on the top/bottom edges).

Some bubble are thrown form the center of the area and are moving toward each player edge.

The main goal for this game is to catch as many bubbles as possible and get points.
Each small bubble, when colliding with the 'feet' of a character, is destroyed and the linked player gets one point (+1).

Sometimes, a bigger and colored bubble spawns : here is the main mechanic of the game :
When the character feet collides with the big colored bubble, the player shall press a specific button.

The game area is divided in 4 triangles, with colors related to their characters.
The position of the color on the map gives you which button shall be pressed.
If you try to catch a big red bubble and the red area (character name : DOOM) is located on the top of the screen, you shall press the upper button on your gamepad (Y button)
It you try to catch a big blue bubble and the blue area (character name : ONDINE) is located on the left of the screen, you shall press the left button on your controller (B button for Gamecube, X button for XBOX)

When a player succeed to catch a big bubble (collision + correct button to press), he gets five points (+5), and this big bubble is randomly sent back to one of the opponents.
If a big bubble is missed, it does nothing, except the player does not mark points.
If a player press a button to get a big bubble, but either the button is not correct, or the big bubble is not colliding with the character feet, the big bubble disappears (and you miss 5 points).
So be careful about timing.

With only 2 players the game is not so fun as you only have 2 buttons to remember.
But when playing the game with 3 or 4 players, players will need skills to perform.

For the moment there is no end condition, though the game will never stop.

If you press ESC, the program will exit.
If you press F10, some debug information such as the FPS is displayed.
If you press F11, the game switches between full screen and windowed-mode

Enjoy !
